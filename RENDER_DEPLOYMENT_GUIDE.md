## Part 2: Deploy Using Blueprint (5 minutes)

### Step 2: Connect Your Repository

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment

Render will now:
- Create both services automatically
- Install Python dependencies for backend

## Troubleshooting

### Backend shows "Starting..."
- **Wait 2-3 minutes** - free tier services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request wakes them up (takes 30-60 seconds)

### CORS Error in Browser Console
- Verify `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in backend includes your exact frontend URL
- Make sure `VITE_API_URL` in frontend points to backend URL
- Clear browser cache: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

### Build Failed
- Check **"Logs"** tab in Render Dashboard
- Look for error messages
- Most common: Missing dependencies (already fixed in render.yaml)

### Frontend Shows 404
- Verify the build completed successfully
- Check that `staticPublishPath` is set to `frontend/dist`
- Ensure routes are configured for SPA (already done in render.yaml)

---

## Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations
- Services **sleep after 15 minutes** of inactivity
- First request after sleep takes **30-60 seconds** to wake up
- 750 hours/month free (enough for small projects)
- If you need 24/7 uptime, upgrade to paid plan ($7/month)

### Keep Services Awake (Optional)
Use a free service like **UptimeRobot** to ping your backend every 14 minutes:
1. Go to [https://uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com)
2. Add monitor: `https://is-it-rain-api.onrender.com/health`
3. Set interval: 15 minutes

## Your Live URLs (After Deployment)

- **Frontend**: `https://is-it-rain.onrender.com`
- **Backend**: `https://is-it-rain-api.onrender.com`
- **API Docs**: `https://is-it-rain-api.onrender.com/docs`
- **Health Check**: `https://is-it-rain-api.onrender.com/health`

## Future Updates

When you push to GitHub:
1. Render **automatically detects** the changes
2. **Automatically redeploys** both services
3. Takes 3-5 minutes
4. No manual steps needed!
