## Troubleshooting Railway

### If backend still shows errors:

#### Option 1: Clear Start Command
```
Settings ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Custom Start Command ‚Üí DELETE IT ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Redeploy
```

#### Option 2: Check Logs
```
Deployments ‚Üí Latest ‚Üí View Logs
Look for errors in red
```

#### Option 3: Verify nixpacks.toml is used
```
In logs, you should see:
"Using Nixpacks"
"cd /app/backend && /app/backend/.venv/bin/uvicorn..."
```

#### Option 4: Environment Variables
```
Make sure ALLOWED_ORIGINS is set correctly
```

## Alternative: PythonAnywhere (100% Free Backend)

If Railway still doesn't work, try **PythonAnywhere**:

2. Click "Start running Python online in less than a minute!"
3. **FREE** tier: No credit card, no trials
4. Can run FastAPI with some setup

## Alternative: Fly.io (Free Tier)

Another option:

1. Go to: [https://fly.io](https://fly.io)
2. Sign up (no credit card for free tier)
3. Install CLI: `curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh`
4. Deploy: `fly launch`

**FREE tier:**
- 3 VMs (256MB RAM each)
- 3GB storage
- Enough for your app!

## My Recommendation

**Try Railway + Netlify first** using the steps above.

The key is:
1. ‚ùå DON'T set custom start command in Railway dashboard
2. ‚úÖ LET nixpacks.toml handle everything
3. ‚úÖ ONLY set environment variables

If it STILL doesn't work after following these steps exactly, let me know and I'll help you set up **Fly.io** or **PythonAnywhere** instead.
